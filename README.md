## Usage/Installation

To run these projects locally both Python and the necessary libraries will have to be installed, here are the steps all done in the CMD Terminal:

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/HarveyBakerHDJ/finance-projects.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd finance-projects

3. Install the required libraries:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Each project contains a jupyter notebook .ipynb for use in jupyter notebook and a python script .py for running the models as a standalone script

4. To start a jupyter notebook and then open the desired file:
    jupyter notebook

5. To run the .py python script:
    python project_name.py
